# Spore - MultipleSaveFiles
A mod for Spore that allows for there to be multiple "master" save files; i.e, the galaxy that hosts all saves on a computer.

By default, Spore only has one "master" save slot; the Game0 folder in the game's appdata directory.  
This mod adds the `setSaveFile` cheat which, when given an integer as a parameter, will set the game to use an equivalent save directory.  
If no "master" save for this integer exists, a new save is generated by reloading the game's main menu.
